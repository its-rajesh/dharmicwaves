In most of these algorithms, the estimation of the BSS filters relies on the accurate association of each time–frequency bin to the dominant source at that bin. The TF bin associations are then used to estimate the statistics of the source signals, and BSS is achieved by optimal spatial filters computed using the estimated statistics.</description></item></channel></rss>
